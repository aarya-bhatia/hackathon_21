Plan
-----------------
Ingredient -> {name,expiry},
Inventory: {Ingredient i -> int quantity},
Recipes: {Ingredient i, int quantity}[]

Algorithm
-> Filter out those recipes from that match a particular number of ingredients which are in the userâ€™s inventory.
-> Give a score to each recipe on the basis of the following:
	-> If the shelf life of item is low, the score should go up
	-> If the cost of missing ingredients is low, should make the score go up
	-> other user preferences (Time of meal etc)
-> Add the recipes to a max priority queue if the score is above a threshold
-> Send the recipes to the user 
-> If there are no recipes, start over but decrease the threshold for the number of ingredients that must match in inventory.
